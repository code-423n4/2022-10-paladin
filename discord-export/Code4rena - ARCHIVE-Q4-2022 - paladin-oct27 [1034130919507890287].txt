there is no 5 days between 27 and 30…


[10/27/2022 19:04] minh___
3 days is likely correct, the 5 days mentioned above is probably a copy paste error

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[10/27/2022 19:29] itsmetechjay
Yes that’s a copy paste error. Will adjust.

[10/28/2022 03:35] chaduke3730
Does each pledge mean a Quest?


[10/28/2022 08:19] Junnon#3182
@Kogaroshii sent friend request, want to DM ser.


[10/28/2022 08:56] ozy42
Tests are really really slow 🥲


[10/28/2022 08:58] ozy42
ok it's because of the resetFork() + redeployment between each tests


[10/28/2022 09:23] rvierdiiev
@Kogaroshi pls, accept friend request


[10/28/2022 09:46] 0x1f8b
The "known issues" contains out of scope contracts, in order to make the work easier to the wardens it should contains only the scoped ones I think


[10/28/2022 09:48] bizzyvinci
@Kogaroshi, `npm run test` does not work


[10/28/2022 09:59] ozy42
replace your rpc endpoint in hadhat.config and utils.ts (resetFork())

[10/28/2022 09:59] Franfran#5067
isn't it caching ? its too bad


[10/28/2022 10:00] ozy42
i'm using describe.only to target only function i test , but yes it's not very good :/


[10/28/2022 10:04] ozy42
I was an Hardhat maxi, now i prefer Foundry lol

Just accepted all requests


[10/28/2022 15:24] saksham#7993
is there any good documentation for the boostv2 curve contract


[10/28/2022 16:01] usf1970
Hello, can delegationBoost contract be considered trusted?


[10/28/2022 17:33] jat4100
Same question


[10/28/2022 18:35] codingsh
I don't consider him reliable, but I believe we need to focus on the main contract


[10/28/2022 19:40] lukejohn_
where can I find the contract for DelegrationBoost?


[10/28/2022 19:41] lukejohn_
/** @notice Address of the Delegation Boost contract */
    IBoostV2 public delegationBoost;


[10/28/2022 19:41] lukejohn_
thanks


[10/28/2022 20:14] kogaroshi
Hey everyone, all the documentation and source for Boostv2 (called delegationBoost our contract) can be found here: https://github.com/curvefi/curve-veBoost

This contract isn't to be 100% trusted, but you can refer to the tests in the Boostv2 repo to check how the contract behaves

[10/28/2022 20:17] ladboy233
Thanks! This is helpful!


[10/28/2022 22:13] chaduke3730
Great will read it tonight


[10/28/2022 23:39] chaduke3730
How does the delegationBoost interact with the votingEscrow contract when the boost is called?    delegationBoost.boost(
            pledgeParams.receiver,
            amount,
            endTimestamp,
            user
        );


[10/28/2022 23:41] chaduke3730
Does it combine all balances (this receiver and all pledge to this receiver?


[10/28/2022 23:41] chaduke3730
To calculate .adjusted_balance_of(pl?


[10/28/2022 23:42] kogaroshi
Boostv2 is a wrapper around veCRV, so other contracts fetch the balance  with delegation from Boostv2 (the adjusted balance, based on veCRV balance with all delegation received etc)


[10/28/2022 23:42] chaduke3730
Thanks


[10/28/2022 23:43] chaduke3730
I think i might have found some vulnerability


[10/28/2022 23:43] chaduke3730
I will write the report tonight

[10/28/2022 23:49] chaduke3730
So the votingEscrow variable refers to  veCRV?


[10/29/2022 00:07] kogaroshi
Yup

[10/30/2022 13:30] jm217
@Kogaroshi do you have a spare alchemy key by any chance that you can share via DM? Seems like Alchemy signup is not working atm


[10/30/2022 13:32] kogaroshi
Sorry, the one I use currently is already used by our internal team, can't share that one
